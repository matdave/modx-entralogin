# MODX Users

When enabled, MODX Users will see a new option to "Login with Entra" on the MDOX Manager login Page.

By default, logging in with entra will match to an existing users email address. If one is found, it will connect the
Entra user to the MODX user. 

## Managing Connection

If a user has an Entra account that differs from their MODX email, they can manage their connection in their profile 
page by clicking "Connect Entra Account".
